# monster_game
(''')
In this game you are given a target field consisting of multiple cells which you need to recreate. Press <t> to show your target field and <r> to show the real field. Use <w>, <a>, <s>, <d> to move through the field and <+> and <-> to increment or decrement the field you are currently standing on (values are given in hex). You can also increment and decrement in steps of 0x10 by using the keys <1> and <2>. Once the target and the real field are equal, you beat the level. 
This is a monster. Do not get eaten by the monster! We are legally required to tell you that we will not cover for your doctor's bill if you get (partially) eaten by the monster!Actually we probably aren't required to tell you that but we do so anyway...
you are playing for fun! Are you ready?
